This folder contains the chapter notebooks for *Derivatives Analytics with Python*. Each notebook mirrors the structure of a chapter and focuses on a small, coherent set of ideas.

## Chapter Notebooks

- `dawp_chapter_01_03.ipynb` — introduction, environment setup, and Part I overview (market-based valuation mindset, payoffs, stylised facts, and rate proxies).
- `dawp_chapter_04.ipynb` — discrete-time market models, self-financing strategies, and risk-neutral valuation.
- `dawp_chapter_05.ipynb` — complete market models: Black–Scholes–Merton, binomial trees, and Greeks.
- `dawp_chapter_06.ipynb` — Fourier-based option pricing: characteristic functions, Lewis integrals, and Carr–Madan FFT.
- `dawp_chapter_07.ipynb` — American options by simulation: Snell envelope, Longstaff–Schwartz LSM, and primal/dual estimators.
- `dawp_chapter_08.ipynb` — first market-based valuation example: Merton (1976) jump-diffusion, multiple valuation methods, and calibration.
- `dawp_chapter_09.ipynb` — general model framework: equity, volatility, and short-rate dynamics (BCC-style) and CIR term structures.
- `dawp_chapter_10.ipynb` — Monte Carlo simulation: CIR and Heston paths, convergence diagnostics, and comparisons to analytical benchmarks.
- `dawp_chapter_11.ipynb` — model calibration: multi-stage calibration of the BCC-style framework to an index option surface.
- `dawp_chapter_12.ipynb` — valuation in the calibrated model: European and American options, plus simulation-based diagnostics.
- `dawp_chapter_13.ipynb` — dynamic delta hedging: hedging experiments in BSM and calibrated BCC dynamics and interpretation of hedging error distributions.

To get started, open a notebook in your preferred Jupyter environment or in Google Colab, run the cells from top to bottom, and compare the results with the corresponding chapters and slide decks.
